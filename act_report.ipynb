    "### WeRateDogs is a twitter account that was formed four years ago and now has more than 7 million followers. The purpose of this account is for users to post their dog, attach a quirky text to it, leave a rating for their dog out of 10 and make their dog perhaps famous! Most users leave higher than 10/10 ratings for their dogs which is part of the unique setup associated with this account.\n",

    "### We will also be able to see what the most common breed of dogs that are tweeted are!"

The tweet read  \"Here's a doggo realizing you can stand in a pool. 13/10 enlightened af (vid by Tina Conrad)\" and it was actually a video and can also see this lovely picture below, that gave it a rating of 13/10."

The Pupper dog stage is by far the larger of the category of dog stages that dogs fit into on this account. This seems to imply that most of the tweet users own fairly small and young dogs. There also exists a mixture of stages and these are dogs that are categorised as identifying with two stages and not just one."
